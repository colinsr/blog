My name is Colin.  I used to be a software guy, now I am a DevOps guy.

I have an insatiable appetite to learn everything.  My approach to learning can be a bit like how Cookie Monster wants to eat all the cookies.

I'm going to be writing posts about all the topics that I think are interesting.

My list of things to learn seems to be growing, it currently includes but is not limited to:
* AWS
* Azure
* Powershell
* Windows Nano Server
* Linux - I'm currently partial to RH
* Docker / Containerization
* Serverless
* Python
* Javascript
* CICD/Continuous Delivery

I want to let someone else do all the boring stuff and leave me to do my own thing.


Buckle up and enjoy the ride.
